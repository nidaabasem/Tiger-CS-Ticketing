/*
  R004 - Read procedures of the rebuilt receivables snapshot.  The application NEVER calls PACT for a page view; it reads these.

    dbo.usp_CollectionsRcv_GetUnits   RECEIVABLES page (and the unit list behind it): one row per apartment of a customer, its payments, filters, totals, paging
    dbo.usp_CollectionsRcv_GetLines   payment rows of a due-date window (used by Campaigns and the Review workflow, whose rules run in the application)
    dbo.usp_CollectionsRcv_GetUnit    Payment Summary: one unit by its normalised key (tower + unit code), never by a phone number
    dbo.usp_CollectionsRcv_GetTowers  active towers for the dropdown

  SEMANTICS (all dates are calendar days; @Today is today in Asia/Dubai, passed by the application; the reference is its CALENDAR MONTH, never the day)
      @MonthStart = first day of @Today's month, @NextMonthStart = first day of the following month (December rolls into January):
        Overdue = DueDate <  @MonthStart
        Due     = DueDate >= @MonthStart AND DueDate < @NextMonthStart      (any day of the current month: past, today or still to come)
        DueDate >= @NextMonthStart is NEVER read, listed, totalled or exported.
    * Only unpaid or partly paid payments exist (remaining Amount > 0; the amount is the REMAINING amount).  Total = Due + Overdue = the sum of the payments the details list.
    * @FromDate / @ToDate only NARROW the DUE-date window (NULL = no bound; @ToDate is capped at the last day of the current month).  A Month/Year filter passes that month's
      first and last day; it never moves @MonthStart: a payment is Due / Overdue against the current month whatever window is chosen.  No window = historic overdue + the whole current month.
    * @Status: all (Due + Overdue, the default) | due | overdue - applied to the PAYMENTS, so every figure below is computed from the payments that match.
    * @MinTotal (NULL = none): applied AFTER the payments of one apartment are summed (Total > @MinTotal, strictly greater), before the counts, paging and export.
    * Excluded before aggregation and paging: unit code containing '*', UnitID <= 0, unit code blank or 0.  Only that apartment is dropped.
    * An apartment is (CompanyId, TenantId, UnitId, UnitCode), compared binary-exactly: other companies, customers and apartments are never merged.
    * The apartment's CONTACT (name / mobile / e-mail as PACT holds them) is that of its earliest matching payment (then smallest voucher, then id) - the same representative row Campaigns use,
      so the two pages never show different PACT contacts for one apartment.
    * ORDER: the NEWEST TOWER FIRST - the tower NUMBER as an integer, descending (TP140, TP132, TP131 ... TP119; never the text, never the name; a non-numeric tower number after all numeric ones),
      then the units of a tower by their unit number ascending (numeric unit numbers before lettered ones, then the unit code text), then company, customer, unit id - a TOTAL order computed over the whole
      filtered set BEFORE the page is cut, so pages never overlap or skip (mirrored by TigerCS.Domain CollectionsTowerOrder); payments by due date DESC, then voucher, then id.
    * TOWER NAMES come from dbo.fn_Collections_TowerNames (V012): CollectionsTowers when its name is a real name, else the single name CRM holds for that company's tower. NULL = no name known (the page shows the number).
    * Search: customer name, mobile, e-mail, customer id, tower number / name, apartment, voucher, project - PACT contact data AND the linked CRM contact.
  Result sets of usp_CollectionsRcv_GetUnits (a contract with RcvReceivablesSource):
    1 scope     ScopeValid, TowerId, CompanyId, TowerNumber, TowerName   (ScopeValid = 0: unknown tower or tower/company clash; nothing else is returned)
    2 status    usp_CollectionsRcv_GetStatus for the companies in scope
    3 totals    UnitCount, LineCount, DueLineCount, OverdueLineCount, DueTotal, OverdueTotal, Total   (over the whole filtered set, before paging)
    4 units     the requested page
    5 lines     the payments of exactly those units (sum per unit = its Total)
