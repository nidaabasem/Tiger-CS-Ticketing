/// <c>@IncludeSettled</c> and <c>@StrictIdentity</c>); none selects a customer, unit or tag, and the ledger and allocation work runs in full whatever the
/// window. The window cannot be narrowed safely either: a unit's quoted amount sums every qualifying instalment from the configured start date, and an
/// older instalment that becomes unpaid again (a reversed cheque) would be missed. So the cost of one revalidation is one full company read, which is
/// why it runs in the background job with a lease heartbeat. Targeted reads need a new, separately reviewed procedure parameter; none is invented here.</para>
