/// "Export for Genesys": a download-only file a person can import into a Genesys outbound contact list by hand. It is NOT a send, and nothing that only a send needs is a condition of it.
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><b>Who is in it.</b> Every customer unit of the chosen campaign type that matches Tower, Payment status, From / To and Minimum Total (<see cref="ReviewQueryService.ResolveForExportAsync"/>),
/// in both modes, on any day, whatever its validation status: Ready, Needs review, held back (reconciliation, PaymentStatusUnknown, legal, shared phone) and already sent alike. The amounts are the
/// ones Preview shows: the one Manual calculation over each unit's stored instalments. Only the person's ticks narrow it (Manual); nothing has to be selected.</item>
/// <item><b>Rows.</b> <see cref="GenesysExportRows"/>: one row per customer unit, exactly the records Preview lists; a phone number is never a key (nothing is merged, added up, de-duplicated or left
/// out because of it). A unit without a calculable amount or a callable number is left out and NAMED with its reason, never silently dropped and never guessed.
/// Each row is built by <see cref="DispatchService.ToPayload"/>, the code that builds a real upload, and written with <see cref="GenesysContactTemplate.WriteCsv(IEnumerable{GenesysContactPayload}, IReadOnlyList{string})"/>:
/// the six columns Phone, CustomerName, Email Address, ReminderType, AmountDue, DueDate, in that order and format. Nothing else about a customer is in the file.</item>
/// <item><b>Columns.</b> When the Genesys integration can read the chosen list, its real columns are used and a list that lacks or misnames a template column refuses the export (an incompatibility
/// is reported, never guessed around). When the list cannot be read (integration not configured, login refused, Genesys unreachable) the documented six-column template is used and the file, the
/// notices and the audit entry say "Template not verified against Genesys".</item>
/// <item><b>Unverified data.</b> An unreconciled source, stale approval data, data built for another day, or included units whose data needs review (PaymentStatusUnknown included) never stop the
/// file; they label it "Financial data not verified" (file name, notices, audit) and say exactly why. The source values are written as they are; an Unknown payment status is never written as unpaid.</item>
/// <item><b>Read only.</b> It uploads nothing, queues nothing and marks no one as sent. The send protections (Ready status, reconciliation, freshness, shared phone, already sent, contacted today,
/// idempotency) belong to <see cref="DispatchService"/> and are untouched: a customer in a file can still be sent, once, under every rule.</item>
/// <item><b>Audited.</b> Each export is written to the audit trail before the file is released (who, when, campaign, list, rows, units, exclusions, total, statuses, verification, the filter, a hash of
/// the file and a one-way fingerprint of each customer's unit and number; never a customer's data). If the audit entry cannot be written, no file is released. Customers exported within
/// <c>ExportRepeatLookbackDays</c> are counted and noted (<c>Repeated=n</c>) so repeated downloads are visible; a repeat never blocks a download and needs no confirmation.</item>
