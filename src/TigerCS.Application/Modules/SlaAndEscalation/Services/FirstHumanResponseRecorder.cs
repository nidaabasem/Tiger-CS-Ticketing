/// <summary>
/// The one place <c>Ticket.FirstHumanResponseAtUtc</c> is satisfied, and
/// everything that must happen with it: the lifecycle history row, the audit
/// entry, and the breach finalization that turns a late first response into a
/// recorded breach (and its automatic Level 2 escalation).
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Why this exists rather than a second mechanism.</b> First Response is
/// reached two ways: a person recording it through
/// <c>POST /api/tickets/{id}/sla/first-response</c>
/// (<see cref="SlaFirstResponseAppService"/>, which owns the authorization and
/// optimistic-concurrency half), and the system observing it when the first
/// genuinely human message of a conversation is stored
/// (<c>GenesysConversationEndAppService</c>). Those are different callers with
/// different permission stories, but the <i>consequence</i> is identical, and
/// ISSUE-019's whole point is that this measurement must be written in exactly
/// one way. Both therefore call this.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>What is deliberately NOT here.</b> No authorization — the API path gates
/// itself and the system path has no user to gate. No transaction and no
/// <c>SaveChangesAsync</c> — this enlists in the caller's unit of work, the
/// same contract <c>SlaDueDateService</c> and
/// <c>TicketAutoAssignmentService</c> follow, so the response and whatever
/// prompted it commit together or not at all. No RowVersion handling: the
/// caller decides whether a stale token is a conflict.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>An AI or automated reply can never reach this.</b> The automated
/// acknowledgement has its own column
/// (<c>Ticket.AcknowledgementSentAtUtc</c>), and the transcript path calls
/// this only for <see cref="InteractionMessageSender.HumanAgent"/> lines —
/// never <see cref="InteractionMessageSender.VirtualAgent"/>. FR-SLA-05 /
/// ISSUE-019 exist precisely because a machine responding instantly would
/// otherwise satisfy every first-response target and make the KPI
/// meaningless.
