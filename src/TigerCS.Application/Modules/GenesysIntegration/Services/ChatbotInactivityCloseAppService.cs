/// than the configured time (<see cref="GenesysOptions.CustomerInactivityTimeout"/>,

/// carries a timer that is strictly older than the timeout (a customer reply
/// clears it; a repeated webhook never moved it); the conversation has not
/// ended; no human follow-up is open (requested handoff, bot connection
/// failure — both raise a <see cref="TicketAgentHandoff"/>); no person owns the
/// ticket (a human assignment); the ticket is still open for work. Any
/// exclusion cancels the timer so it stops being a candidate, and closes
/// nothing.

/// <para>
/// <b>Race with a customer reply.</b> The timer column is a concurrency

/// <para>
/// <b>Idempotent.</b> The interaction's <c>InactivityClosedAtUtc</c> is
