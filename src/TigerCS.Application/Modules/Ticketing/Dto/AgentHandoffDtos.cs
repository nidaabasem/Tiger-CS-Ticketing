/// </summary>
/// <param name="TicketAgentHandoffId">The work item.</param>
/// <param name="TicketId">The ticket the work belongs to — never a new one.</param>
/// <param name="TicketNumber">The ticket's human-facing number. Empty on a mutation response, which reports the work item rather than re-reading the ticket.</param>
/// <param name="TicketInteractionId">The interaction the work arose from.</param>
/// <param name="GenesysConversationId">The Genesys conversation behind that interaction, when it had one.</param>
/// <param name="DepartmentId">The department the work belongs to.</param>
/// <param name="ChannelId">The channel the customer used.</param>
/// <param name="Status">One of NotRequired, WaitingForAgent, Assigned, InProgress, Completed, Cancelled — TigerCS' own vocabulary, not Genesys'.</param>
/// <param name="Mode">Callback, ContinueChat, ReplyInChannel or HumanTakeover — or null when the caller did not say. Never inferred from the channel.</param>
/// <param name="RequestReason">Why a human was needed, as reported (e.g. a virtual agent's escalation reason). Null when not supplied.</param>
/// <param name="RequestedAtUtc">When a human was first asked for — what "waiting since" is measured from.</param>
/// <param name="AssignedEmployeeId">The TigerCS employee handling it, when known.</param>
/// <param name="GenesysAgentId">Genesys' own agent identifier, when supplied — recorded even when no TigerCS employee matches.</param>
/// <param name="AssignedAtUtc">When an agent was named.</param>
/// <param name="StartedAtUtc">When an agent began handling it.</param>
/// <param name="CompletedAtUtc">When the work was completed.</param>
/// <param name="ResolvedAtUtc">When the work stopped being outstanding, by completion or cancellation. Null exactly while it is still pending.</param>
/// <param name="ResolutionNote">What the agent recorded on finishing, or the required reason for cancelling.</param>
/// <param name="CustomerName">The customer's name as the channel collected it.</param>
/// <param name="CustomerPhone">The customer's number for this interaction.</param>
/// <param name="RequestSummary">The ticket's one-line summary. Empty on a mutation response.</param>
/// <param name="TicketStatus">The ticket's own status — separate from this work item's, and never changed by it. Empty on a mutation response.</param>
/// <param name="TicketIsClassified">False while the ticket is still Unclassified — pending human work never waits for classification.</param>
/// <param name="InteractionEnded">Whether the live conversation already ended. The work stays actionable either way: a customer who closed the browser still needs an answer.</param>
/// <param name="ExternalWorkItemId">Genesys' own routing-task/work-item id, when it supplies one. External identifier only.</param>
