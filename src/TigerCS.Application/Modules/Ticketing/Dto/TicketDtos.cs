/// prevent ticket creation — Ticket Category is the only thing every ticket
/// requires (business-rule change: customer lookup is enrichment, never a
/// creation gate, for unit-related and non-unit-related intakes alike).
/// </summary>
/// <param name="IntakeRecordId">Required. The intake record to promote. It must not already be linked to a ticket.</param>
/// <param name="UnitReferenceId">
/// Optional. The local reference id of a unit the agent selected from a
/// customer-lookup match (<c>GET /api/intake-records/{id}/customer-lookup</c>).
/// Must be supplied together with <paramref name="ContactReferenceId"/> or
/// not at all — never one without the other.
/// </param>
/// <param name="ContactReferenceId">Optional. The matching contact's local reference id — see <paramref name="UnitReferenceId"/>.</param>
/// <param name="CrmBuyerCustomerId">
/// Optional. The real CRM Buyer Lookup match's customer id
/// (<c>GET /api/crm/buyers</c> — phone search only) the agent selected.
/// Must be supplied together with <paramref name="CrmBuyerLeadId"/>,
/// <paramref name="CrmBuyerUnitId"/>, and <paramref name="CrmBuyerProjectId"/>
/// or not at all. Mutually exclusive with <paramref name="ManualProjectName"/>/
/// <paramref name="ManualUnitNumber"/> — a ticket carries a real CRM Buyer
/// match or a manually-entered Project/Unit Number, never both.

/// <param name="CrmBuyerProjectName">Optional display snapshot of the selected unit's project name.</param>
/// <param name="CrmBuyerUnitNumber">Optional display snapshot of the selected unit's number.</param>
/// <param name="ManualProjectName">
/// Required, together with <paramref name="ManualUnitNumber"/>, whenever no
/// <paramref name="CrmBuyerUnitId"/> is supplied — i.e. CRM Buyer Lookup
/// found no match for the intake's phone number, or CRM was unavailable.
/// Never used to run another CRM lookup — CRM is searched by phone number
/// only.
/// </param>
/// <param name="ManualUnitNumber">Required together with <paramref name="ManualProjectName"/> — see that parameter.</param>
/// <param name="CategoryId">
/// The ticket's business classification, which also determines the
/// department it routes to. Optional <b>only</b> for the Unclassified path —
/// an inquiry that must become a ticket before anyone has read the request
/// (Genesys ingestion) — where <paramref name="DepartmentId"/> supplies the
/// department instead. Every agent-driven creation supplies it, and a
/// category is never invented to stand in for a missing one.
/// </param>
/// <param name="DepartmentId">
/// Required <b>only</b> when <paramref name="CategoryId"/> is omitted: the
/// already-resolved department the unclassified ticket belongs to. Ignored
/// when a category is supplied, since the category itself routes the ticket.
/// </param>
/// <param name="PriorityId">
/// 1=Critical, 2=High, 3=Medium, 4=Low. Required whenever
/// <paramref name="CategoryId"/> is supplied, and must be <b>omitted</b> when
/// it is not: an unclassified ticket carries no priority, because nobody has
/// judged its urgency yet, and a default would rank it against tickets a
/// human actually triaged.
/// </param>
/// <param name="RequestSummary">Required. The caller's request, in the agent's words.</param>
/// <param name="CustomerVerificationSource">The external lookup source that verified the customer ("Pact"/"Tasleeh") when the agent selected a matched external customer/unit. Mutually exclusive with the CrmBuyer* identifiers; accompanies (never replaces) the manual Project/Unit snapshot.</param>
/// <param name="ExternalCustomerId">The source's own customer identifier (for PACT, its tenantID) — an external identifier only, stored for audit/reconciliation; requires <paramref name="CustomerVerificationSource"/>.</param>
/// <param name="ExternalUnitId">The source's own identifier for the selected unit (for PACT, its unitID) — same rule as <paramref name="ExternalCustomerId"/>.</param>
/// <param name="ExternalCustomerName">The verified external customer's own name as the source returned it (PACT's <c>customerName</c>) — a ticket-time display snapshot, the external counterpart of <paramref name="CrmBuyerCustomerName"/>. Optional: null when the source holds no name.</param>
/// <param name="ExternalCustomerEmail">The verified external customer's own email as the source returned it (PACT's <c>customerEmail</c>) — a ticket-time display snapshot. Optional: null when the source holds no email.</param>
/// <param name="RequestTypeId">Optional (Workflow/Automation phase 2): the configured Request Type this ticket follows. Must be an active request type of the department the ticket routes to; when present it drives the workflow capabilities and the automatic assignment rule.</param>
/// <param name="GenesysContext">Optional (Workflow/Automation phase 2): the Genesys-provided interaction context, persisted verbatim for traceability. Absent for Face-to-Face and every other locally-created interaction.</param>
