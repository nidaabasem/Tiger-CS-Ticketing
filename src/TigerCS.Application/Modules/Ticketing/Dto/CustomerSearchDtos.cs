/// external lookups — with each source's own outcome reported independently,
/// exactly as the New Ticket wizard's lookup step reports them. Composes the
/// existing per-source DTO shapes rather than remapping them, so the
/// workspace and the wizard can never drift apart on what a match looks
/// like. Phone is the only search key: no integrated source supports
/// customer search by name or unit number today, and this contract does not
