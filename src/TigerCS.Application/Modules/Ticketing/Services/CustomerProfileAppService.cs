/// <summary>
/// Customer Details/Profile — the Overview/Contact Info/Units tabs on the
/// Customer Profile page. Ticket-anchored, exactly like
/// <see cref="CustomerHistoryAppService.GetForTicketAsync"/>: the identity
/// (<c>CrmBuyerCustomerId</c>) and the department-visibility check both come
/// from the anchor ticket, never from a caller-supplied phone number or CRM
/// id — a caller cannot use this to browse a customer they could not
/// otherwise see via Ticket Details.
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Thin orchestration only — no CRM logic duplicated.</b> This service
/// does exactly four things: authorize against the ticket (reusing
/// <see cref="TicketQueryAppService"/>, same as Ticket Details itself),
/// resolve the phone number the ticket was verified against (see below),
/// delegate the actual CRM search to <see cref="CrmBuyerLookupAppService"/>
/// — the same service the New Ticket wizard's CRM Buyer Lookup step uses,
/// through the same real <c>ICrmBuyerLookupGateway</c> — and confirm the
/// Buyer CRM returned is the ticket's own persisted customer. It re-filters
/// nothing, selects no unit, and re-queries CRM through nothing else: the
/// older generic <c>ICrmGateway</c> port (unit-number lookup, Mock-only at
/// this phase) is deliberately not a dependency here — every field the
/// profile shows is already carried by <see cref="CrmBuyerMatchDto"/>.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Phone resolution.</b> CRM is searched by phone number only, and the
/// phone is never caller-supplied: it comes from the IntakeRecord this
/// ticket was promoted from (the same resolution
/// <see cref="CustomerHistoryAppService"/> uses for its unverified
/// fallback), or — for a ticket with no linked IntakeRecord — from the
/// ticket's originating <c>TicketInteraction</c>, which persists the same
/// intake phone at creation time. A CRM-verified ticket with neither on
/// record reports <c>"NoPhoneOnRecord"</c> rather than pretending CRM was
/// asked and could not answer.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Identity is validated, never inferred from the phone alone.</b> A
/// phone number can be reassigned in CRM after the ticket was created. The
/// Buyer CRM returns is accepted only when its CustomerId equals the
/// ticket's persisted <c>CrmBuyerCustomerId</c>; any other customer is
/// reported as <c>"NotFoundInCrm"</c> (CRM no longer resolves this phone to
/// this customer) and logged for investigation, so the page never silently
/// shows a different customer's name, contact details or units.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Live CRM data, unlike Customer History.</b> Previous Tickets on the
/// Customer Profile page reuses <c>CustomerHistoryAppService</c> unchanged
/// (via its own existing endpoint) precisely because history must work with
/// CRM offline; Overview/Contact Info/Units cannot make that promise — full
/// name (Arabic), mobile number, email, and the customer's full current unit
/// list simply do not exist anywhere in Ticketing's own persisted data, only
/// in CRM. When CRM cannot be searched (unavailable, no longer finds a
/// match, or a data-integrity conflict), <see cref="CustomerProfileDto.Status"/>
/// says so and the caller still knows the ticket's own CrmBuyerCustomerId.
