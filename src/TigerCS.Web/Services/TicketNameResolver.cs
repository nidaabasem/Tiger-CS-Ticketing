/// <summary>
/// Best-effort id → name resolution for the fields TigerCS.Api returns as
/// raw ids with no dedicated lookup endpoint (see the PR description's
/// "Contract gaps" section). Every resolution here is backed by a real,
/// contract-guaranteed fact — never a guess:
///
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>Department names come from the Department directory
/// (<c>GET /api/departments?activeOnly=false</c>, viewable by any
/// authenticated staff member), so every department a ticket can belong to
/// — including one deactivated since — resolves to its name; the caller's
/// own memberships (<c>GET /api/users/me</c>) are merged in as well. A raw
/// department id is never the normal display; only a failed directory call
/// leaves a name unresolved, and callers then degrade to neutral wording.</item>
/// <item>An assigned owner is guaranteed by the Assign endpoint's own
/// business rule to be an active member of the ticket's current department
/// (<c>EmployeeNotInDepartment</c> outcome), so paging that department's
/// member list (<c>GET /api/departments/{id}/users</c>) to match the id is a
/// correct resolution, not a guess. Bounded to 100 members; beyond that the
/// id is shown as-is rather than paging indefinitely.</item>
/// <item>A note's author is resolved only when it is the signed-in caller
/// themself (a real, already-known fact) — there is no membership guarantee
/// for note authorship, so any other author id is shown as-is.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// Category names are resolved by <see cref="CategoriesApiClient"/> where a
/// Category is being <i>selected</i> (the New Ticket wizard's Category
/// dropdown) — this resolver's own remit is only the ids above, so a
/// Category shown elsewhere as a bare id (e.g. an existing ticket's
/// CategoryId) is still shown as-is by callers of this service; wiring that
/// display up to the same endpoint is a separate follow-up, not done here.
/// Registered scoped, so its per-request caches live for one page render.
