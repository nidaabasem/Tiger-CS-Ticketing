# Customer notification mode and satisfaction reviews

Builds on `docs/Customer-Email-Notifications.md` (same Outbox → handler → `ICustomerEmailSender` pipeline; no second mechanism).

## Configuration (`CustomerNotifications`)
| Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `IsTestMode` | `true` | Only an explicit `false` delivers to real customers. Missing/blank/unrecognised ⇒ test mode. |
| `TestEmail` | empty | Test mode: receives **every** customer email. Missing/invalid ⇒ those emails are skipped (warning logged). |
| `TestPhone` | empty | Test mode: receives **every** customer SMS (international digits; `+`, spaces, `00` accepted). Missing/invalid ⇒ SMS skipped (warning logged). |
| `PublicBaseUrl` | empty | Public Ticketing **Web** URL; used for review links and the logo. Empty ⇒ emails carry no review section. |
| `ReviewLinkLifetimeDays` | 14 | |
| `Branding:LogoUrl / WebsiteUrl / ContactEmail / ContactPhone` | logo = `{PublicBaseUrl}/img/tiger-logo.png`, site `https://tigergroup.ae`, contact blank | Blank contact lines are omitted. |

`EmailNotifications:Enabled` stays the master email switch (default `false`). The old `CustomerNotifications:Mode` key is gone.

## Behaviour
- **`IsTestMode = true`**: Created, Resolved, Closed, Reopened, OTP, document delivery, Collections reminders and every other customer email go to `TestEmail` (subject `[TEST] …`; ticket emails also carry a banner); every customer SMS goes to `TestPhone`. The customer's own address/number is never used and never a fallback. Staff mail (`EmailAudience.Internal`) is untouched. Templates and triggers are unchanged, and Resolved/Closed carry the review (flagged `IsTest`, excluded from production figures).
- **`IsTestMode = false`**: messages go to their intended recipients exactly as before; Resolved/Closed carry the review invitation.
- Routing happens once, at the final boundary: `IEmailSender`/`ISmsSender` are wrapped by `CustomerDeliveryGuard*Sender`. `EmailMessage.Audience` defaults to `Customer`, so a caller that forgets to classify is still redirected. The old `VerificationTesting` redirect still runs first, but in test mode the guard re-addresses to `TestEmail`/`TestPhone`.

## Reviews
Tables `TicketReviewInvitations` (SHA-256 of a random 256-bit token, expiry, ticket + reopen cycle, `IsTest`) and `TicketReviews` (1–5, comment ≤1000, unique per ticket cycle + IsTest). Page `GET /Review?t=&r=` only shows the form; the review is saved by the antiforgery-protected POST. Anonymous API: `POST /api/public/ticket-reviews/lookup|submit` (token in body). Closed email skips the invitation if a review exists.

## Deploy
1. Apply `AddCustomerSatisfactionReviews.sql` (migration `20261022081031_AddCustomerSatisfactionReviews`).
2. Set per environment: `CustomerNotifications__IsTestMode`, `__TestEmail` and `__TestPhone` (UAT), `__PublicBaseUrl`, optional `__Branding__ContactEmail`.
3. Production customer delivery stays off until `CustomerNotifications__IsTestMode=false` **and** `EmailNotifications__Enabled=true` are set deliberately.
